## ðŸ“© Email Submission (Using W3Forms)

This contact form uses [W3Forms](https://w3forms.com/) â€” a free, no-backend form submission service â€” to collect and forward user messages to a specified email address.

### How It Works:
- When the form is submitted, W3Forms securely sends the input data (Name, Email, Message) to the configured email address.
- No backend code or server deployment is required.
